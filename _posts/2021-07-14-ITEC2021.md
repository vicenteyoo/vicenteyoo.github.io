>This paper analyzes the stability of sensorless permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives, which adopts the proportional-integral (PI) controller-type position estimator. 
>Due to the limited bandwidth of the angle estimation, the sensorless position estimator can cause a transient angle error, 
>leading to a torque discrepancy between the reference and the actual value. This phenomenon can be more severe in the flux weakening region. 
>If this torque error is not damped sufficiently through the shaft inertia, the rotor angle would also oscillate. 
>Unless the position estimator provides a sufficiently fast dynamic performance to follow the trembling rotor shaft, the system may lose stability. 
>This paper calculates the required minimum bandwidth of the position estimator to ensure control stability. The analysis is verified through the simulation and experimental tests.
