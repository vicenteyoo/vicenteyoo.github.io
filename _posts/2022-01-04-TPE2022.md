>The overmodulation scheme plays an essential role 
in the dynamic performance of the current regulation under 
voltage limitation. This paper analyses how the non-linearity of the 
voltage hexagon affects dynamic overmodulation. Most dynamic 
overmodulation schemes had considered the voltage hexagon as 
the limit of the output voltage to maximize the voltage utilization. 
However, these schemes do not show uniform dynamic 
performance according to the rotor position on the voltage 
hexagon. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an 
overmodulation scheme that is robust against the rotor position 
variation. The computer simulation and experimental results 
verify that the proposed method has consistent performance 
regardless of the rotor position with less d-axis current overshoot 
keeping the fast dynamics.
