>This paper proposes an experimental parameter identification method for induction motor drives. To find the motor parameters at each operating point, the rank-deficiency problem is circumvented by the finite element analysis (FEA). The stator inductance look-up-table (LUT) is constructed assisted by FEA, and the leakage inductance and the rotor resistance are calculated based on the experimental tests. The proposed parameter identification can be used for a wide range field-oriented control in the traction motor. The proposed parameter identification is verified with the experimental tests.
